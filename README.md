# Effective AI Agents Are All You Need

This repo is a collection of different experiments, projects, and notebooks I created to explore how to build effective AI agents!

I wanted to dive head-first into building AI agents and learn how to work with a a diverse toolkit of the latest innovations in LLMs, agents, and frameworks.

## What I learned!
Some of the tools I've played around with through this adventure include:
* Claude
* LangChain and LangGraph
* the Instructor library
* Pydantic
* Tool-calling frameworks
* Structured output
* And more!

## Resources
I found the following resources super helpful while exploring how to build effective AI agents:
* Anthropic's guide on [Building Effective AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)
    * And Anthropic's [cookbook for building effective agents](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents)
* Dave Ebbelaar's [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx5OapbK-8A) and [AI Cookbook](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook)
* LangChain's [YouTube tutorial on how to build effective agents with LangChain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCDrAbH_go) as well as their [Notion page](https://mirror-feeling-d80.notion.site/Workflow-And-Agents-17e808527b1780d792a0d934ce62bee6)
* LangChain's official documentation and [tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)
    * LangGraph also has their own walkthrough on [building effective agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/)
* CodeBasic's AI Agents [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnXdddeZ4tQ) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codebasics/langgraph-crash-course/tree/main)

## Fantastic APIs I found while coding this project!
* [Hardcover for looking up books and authors](https://hardcover.app/account/api)
* [TMDB for movie information](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
* [The Art Institute of Chicago's API for art](https://api.artic.edu/docs/)
